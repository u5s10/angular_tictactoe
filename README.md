# Angular tictactoe-app
Simple tictactoe app made in Angular inspired by the [React tutorial](https://en.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Main reason for creating this app was to familiarize myself with Angular and concepts like Parent-Child component relations and their communication with `@Input`, `@Output`. Using standard directives like `*ngFor`, `*ngIf`.

## Live demo
